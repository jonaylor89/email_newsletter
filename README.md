# Email Newsletter

There are plenty of improvements:

* What happens if a user tries to subscribe twice? Make sure that they receive two confirmation emails;

* What happens if a user clicks on a confirmation link twice?

* What happens if the subscription token is well-formatted but non-existent?

* Add validation on the incoming token, we are currently passing the raw user input straight into a query (thanks sqlx for protecting us from SQL injections <3);

* Use a proper templating solution for our emails (e.g. tera);
Anything that comes to your mind!
